## Demo

See the [demo](https://sindresorhus.com/norway-postal-codes) for an example on how to auto-complete city from postal code.<br>
Which is a really good UX feature you should make use of.


## Getting started

Even though all converted files are provided here, you might want to do it yourself.

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), then `cd` into this folder and `npm install`.

Run `npm run make` to fetch and convert the latest registry, or you can supply a file path `npm run make postnummerregister_ansi.txt` to convert a local file (make sure it's the ANSI version).

You can also use it as a Node module. Just install it `npm install norway-postal-codes` and then require it in your code:

```js
const postalCodes = require('norway-postal-codes');

console.log(postalCodes['1613']);
// FREDRIKSTAD
```
